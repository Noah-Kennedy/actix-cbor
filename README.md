# Overview
This crate provides an extractor for working with CBOR.
It closely mirrors the API for JSON extraction within Actix-Web, and in fact borrows most of it's
code from Actix-Web

## Stability
Don't use this at all until I publish it to crates.io.
I plan to publish it as soon as I write tests for it.
